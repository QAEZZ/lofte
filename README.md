# Lofte

Lofte (technically Lof Text Editor, but don't call it Lof; it's Lofte) is a simple text editor that aims to provide a vim-like lightweight feel.

Included are three simple tabs: the explorer, simple git client, and an extensions tab. Having VS Code extensions be supported is planned but not promised.

Lofte **will** be cross-platform (except for MacOS, potentially...)
